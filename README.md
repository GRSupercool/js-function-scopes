# JavaScript Functions & Scopes 

## short URL to this repo [jsfunc.sage.codes](https://github.com/sagecodes/into-to-sql)

## Setting up your computer:

- Open your web browser. I'll be using [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), but  you can use [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) or [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)(browsers that support [Web SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_SQL_Database)). 
- to speed up learning we're going to use an [online editor and database](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all) for SQL from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). 

That was easy!

## About me:
I'm [Sage Elliott](http://sageelliott.com/). I'm a Technology Evangelist at Galvanize Seattle. In the past decade I've worked as a software and hardware engineer with mostly with Startups and Agencies in Seattle and Central Florida. I love technology! I'm currently learning more about Deep Learning & Computer Vision.

*caveat* I'm not an Galvanize instructor, They have much more industry experience and are better at teaching difficult topics!

If you have an event you would like to see or put on let me know! I'm always looking for ideas. Talk to me after the workshop or find me online at one of these:

One of the best things about these in person workshops is being able to meet new people! Talk to each other!


## What this workshop is

A super friendly introduction to JavaScript Functions and Scopes.

You can't learn EVERYTHING in ~2 hours. But you can learn enough to get excited and comfortable to keep working and learning on your own!

- This course is for absolute beginners
- Ask Questions!
- Answer Questions!
- Help others when you can
- Its ok to get stuck, just ask for help!
- Feel free to move ahead

### Challenges:

Get the most out of this workkshop! We'll occasionally do a "CHALLENGE" where I give you an exercise to do in several minutes. It can be even more effective to partner up with someome next to you, but you can work on your own if you want. No pressure to solve the challenge. I'll share how I would solve it after the time is up.
